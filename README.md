# LUV Media
A prototype skeleton repository to manage media content for the LUV program. The repository organizes media materials into the following folders:
- models: for 3d models.
- renders: for generated renders of 3D models.
- animations: for generated video animations of 3D models.
- infographics: for 2D infographics and timeline drawings.

See the `README.md` files in each folder for more details. Leveraging Gitlab facilitates back-and-forth collaboration with the art team, even during the early concept stage.
