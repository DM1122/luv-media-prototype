# LUV Media

A prototype skeleton repository to manage media content for the LUV program. The repository organizes media materials into the following folders:

- models: for 3d models.
- renders: for generated renders of 3D models.
- animations: for generated video animations of 3D models.
- infographics: for 2D infographics and timeline drawings.

See the `README.md` files in each folder for more details. Leveraging Gitlab facilitates back-and-forth collaboration with the art team, even during the early concept stage.

Gitlab enables:

- Use of pull requests to submit updates to the artwork or design concept. Allows for structured approach to providing feedback. See [sample pull request](https://github.com/DM1122/luv-media-prototype/pull/1).
- Allows viewing of diffs between images (before & after) in pull requests. See [sample commit diff](https://github.com/DM1122/luv-media-prototype/pull/1/commits/54aa652324c109ec347a533520b718c898066d3f).
- Creation of branches to allow for parallel work or design variant creation. See [branches](https://github.com/DM1122/luv-media-prototype/branches).
- Creation of baselines. See [sample release](https://github.com/DM1122/luv-media-prototype/releases/tag/v1.0.0).
- Raising of issues with existing artwork. See [sample issue](https://github.com/DM1122/luv-media-prototype/issues/2).
- Allows for viewing of `.stl` 3D models directly in the browser. See [Heliostat model sample](https://github.com/DM1122/luv-media-prototype/blob/main/models/heliostat/heliostat.stl).
