# LUV Media
A prototype skeleton repository to manage media content for the LUV program. The repository organizes media materials into the following folders:
- `models`: for 3d models.
- `renders`: for generated renders of 3D models.
- `animations`: for generated video animations of 3D models.
- `infographics`: for 2D infographics and timeline drawings.

See the `README.md` files in each folder for more details. Leveraging Gitlab facilitates back-and-forth collaboration with the art team. This is arguably even more important during the early concept stage as rapid iterations are made and the art needs to be kept in sync with the source design concept.
