Folder for 3D models.
- Models can be defined by simplified requirements and/or system architecture diagrams.
-  Objects can be stored as `.stl` files for ease of viewing on Gitlab, or a text file with a URL can trace to CAD models stored in mass storage (sharepoint) with a permalink to the latest version. This permalink should be updated on creation of a new version to notify stakeholders.
